# 📘 **Notes: Dynamic Method Dispatch**
---

Dynamic Method Dispatch (DMD) in Java is one of the **core OOP concepts**—it allows Java to decide **at runtime** which overridden method to execute. This is the foundation of **runtime polymorphism**.

---

# ✅ **What is Dynamic Method Dispatch?**

Dynamic Method Dispatch is the mechanism by which a **call to an overridden method** is resolved **at runtime**, not compile time.

It allows Java to pick the **correct version of an overridden method** based on the **actual object type**, even if the reference is of a parent class.

---

# 🔥 **Why do we need it?**

* To achieve **runtime polymorphism**
* To allow **flexible and extensible code**
* To write code that works on **parent types but executes child behavior**

---

# 📌 **Key Rule**

> Java always decides **the method to run based on the actual object’s class**, not the reference variable type.

---

# 📝 **Example**

```java
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    @Override
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Cat meows");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal obj;      // reference variable of parent class

        obj = new Dog(); // object of Dog
        obj.sound();     // Output: Dog barks

        obj = new Cat(); // object of Cat
        obj.sound();     // Output: Cat meows
    }
}
```

### 🔍 **Explanation**

* `Animal obj` → Reference of parent class.
* `obj = new Dog()` → refers to a Dog object.
* Even though the reference is of type `Animal`, Java calls **Dog’s overridden sound()** because the object type is Dog.

This is **Dynamic Method Dispatch**.

---

# ⚙️ **How it works internally?**

* Java uses a mechanism called **V-Table (Virtual Method Table)** underneath.
* During runtime, JVM checks the actual object’s class and calls that class’s version of the method.

---

# ❗Things Dynamic Method Dispatch Applies To

* Only works with **overridden** methods (not overloaded methods).
* Only works with **non-static**, **non-final** methods.

---

# ❌ What DMD does *not* apply to:

| Feature             | Why not?                                     |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Static methods**  | They belong to the class, not the object     |
| **Private methods** | They cannot be overridden                    |
| **Final methods**   | Cannot be overridden, so no runtime decision |
