# 📘 **Notes: Encapsulation**
---

## ✅ **Why hide things?**
- To make the interface simpler, we may want to hide unnecessary details.
- To protect the integrity of data on an object, we may hide or restrict access to some of the data and operations.
- To decouple the published interface from the internal details of the class, we may hide actual names and types of class members.

## ✅ **Problems of Direct Access**
- Allowing direct access to data on an object can potentially bypass checks and additional processing your class has in place to manage the data.
- Allowing direct access to fields means calling code would need to change when you edit any of the fields.
- Omitting a constructor that would accept initialization data means the calling code is responsible for setting up this data on the new object.
