## ✅ **Inheritance vs Composition**
- Inheritance defines an IS A relationship.
```java
public class Product
{
    private String model;
    private String manufacturer;
    private int width;
    private int height;
    private int depth;

    public Product(String model, String manufacturer)
    {
        this.model = model;
        this.manufacturer = manufacturer;
    }
}

public class Monitor extends Product
{
    public Monitor(String model, String manufacturer)
    {
        super(model, manufacturer);
    }
}

public class MotherBoard extends Product
{
    public MotherBoard(String model, String manufacturer)
    {
        super(model, manufacturer);
    }
}

public class ComputerCase extends Product
{
    public ComputerCase(String model, String manufacturer)
    {
        super(model, manufacturer);
    }
}
```
- Composition defines a HAS A relationship.
