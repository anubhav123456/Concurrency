# 📘 **Notes: Object Oriented Programming**
---

## ✅ **OOPs**
- Object Oriented Programming is a way to model real objects as software objects which contain both data and code. 
---

## ✅ **Classes**
- The classes describes the data(fields) and the behavior(methods), that are relevant to real-world object we want to describe. 
- These are called class members. 
- A class member can be a field or a method or some type of a dependent element. 
---

## ✅ **Encapsulation**
- Encapsualtion in oops has two meanings. 
- one is the bundling of the behavior attributes on a single object. 
- The other is the practice of hiding fields and some methods from public access. 
---

## ✅ **Getters & Setters**
- A getter is a method on class that retrieves the value of private field and returns it. 
- A setter is a method on class that sets the value of private fields. 
- The purpose of these methods is to control and protect access to private fields.
