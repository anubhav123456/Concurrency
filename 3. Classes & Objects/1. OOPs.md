# 📘 **Notes: Object Oriented Programming**
---

## ✅ **OOPs**
- Object Oriented Programming is a way to model real objects as software objects which contain both data and code. 
---

## ✅ **Classes**
- The classes describes the data(fields) and the behavior(methods), that are relevant to real-world object we want to describe. 
- These are called class members. 
- A class member can be a field or a method or some type of a dependent element. 
---

## ✅ **Encapsulation**
- Encapsualtion in oops has two meanings. 
- one is the bundling of the behavior attributes on a single object. 
- The other is the practice of hiding fields and some methods from public access. 
---

## ✅ **Getters & Setters**
- A getter is a method on class that retrieves the value of private field and returns it. 
- A setter is a method on class that sets the value of private fields. 
- The purpose of these methods is to control and protect access to private fields.

```java
public class Account
{
    private String number;
    private double balance;
    private String customerName;
    private String customerEmail;
    private String customerPhone;

    public void setNumber(String number)
    {
        this.number = number;
    }

    public void setBalance(double balance)
    {
        this.balance = balance;
    }

    public void setCustomerName(String customerName)
    {
        this.customerName = customerName;
    }

    public void setCustomerEmail(String customerEmail)
    {
        this.customerEmail = customerEmail;
    }

    public void setCustomerPhone(String customerPhone)
    {
        this.customerPhone = customerPhone;
    }

    public String getNumber()
    {
        return number;
    }

    public double getBalance()
    {
        return balance;
    }

    public String getCustomerName()
    {
        return customerName;
    }

    public String getCustomerEmail()
    {
        return customerEmail;
    }

    public String getCustomerPhone()
    {
        return customerPhone;
    }
}
