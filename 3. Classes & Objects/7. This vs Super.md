# 📘 **Notes: This vs Super**
---

## ✅ **This vs Super**
- The keyword super is used to access or call the parent class members (both variables and methods).
- The keyword this is used to call the current class members (both variables and methods).
- this is required when we have a parameter with the same name as an instance variable or field.
- NOTE: We can use either of these two keywords anywhere in a class except for static elements such as a static method. Any attempt to do so will lead to compile time errors. 
---

## ✅ **This**
- The keyword this is commonly used within constructors and setters and is optionally used within getters.
```java
public class House 
{
    private String color;

    public House(String color) 
    {
        // this keyword is required, same parameter name as field
        this.color = color;
    }

    public String getColor() 
    {
        // this is optional
        return color; // same as return this.color;
    }

    public void setColor(String color) 
    {
        // this keyword is required, same parameter name as field
        this.color = color;
    }
}
```
- In this example, We are using the this keyword in a constructor and setter since there's a parameter with the same name as the instance or field.
- In the getter, We don't have any parameters so there's no conflict. Therefore, the use of this is optional there.
---

## ✅ **Super**
- The keyword super is commonly used with method overriding when we call a method with the same name from the parent class.
```java
class SuperClass 
{ 
    // parent class aka super class

    public void printMethod() 
    {
        System.out.println("Printed in SuperClass.");
    }
}

class SubClass extends SuperClass 
{ 
    // subclass aka child class

    // overrides methods from the parent class
    @Override
    public void printMethod() 
    {
        super.printMethod(); // calls the method in the SuperClass (parent)
        System.out.println("Printed in Subclass.");
    }
}

class MainClass 
{

    public static void main(String[] args) 
    {
        SubClass s = new SubClass();
        s.printMethod();
    }
}
```
- In this example, We have a method called ```printMethod``` that calls ```super.printMethod```.
---

## ✅ **This vs Super**
- In Java, we've got the this() and super() calls. Notice the parentheses. These are known as calls since they look like regular method calls although we're calling certain constructors.
- Use this() to call a constructor from another overloaded constructor in the same class.
- The call to this() can only be used in a constructor, and it must be the first statement in a constructor.
- It's used with constructor chaining, in other words, when one constructor calls another constructor, and it helps to reduce duplicated code.
- The only way to call a parent constructor is by calling super(), which calls the parent constructor.
- The Java compiler puts a default call to super() if we don't add it, and it's always a call to the no argument constructor, which is inserted by the compiler.
- The call to super() must be the first statement in each constructor.
- A constructor can have a call to super() or this(), but never both.

## ✅ **Bad Example**
```java
class Rectangle 
{

    private int x;
    private int y;
    private int width;
    private int height;

    public Rectangle() 
    {
        this.x = 0;
        this.y = 0;
        this.width = 0;
        this.height = 0;
    }

    public Rectangle(int width, int height) 
    {
        this.x = 0;
        this.y = 0;
        this.width = width;
        this.height = height;
    }

    public Rectangle(int x, int y, int width, int height) 
    {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
        this.width = width;
        this.height = height;
    }
}
```
- This example shows an example of poorly implemented constructor overloading without chaining.
- The code is highlighted as "BAD" because it repeats initialization logic across multiple constructors instead of using constructor chaining with ```this()```.

## ✅ **Good Example**
```java
class Rectangle 
{

    private int x;
    private int y;
    private int width;
    private int height;

    // 1st constructor
    public Rectangle() 
    {
        this(0, 0); // calls 2nd constructor
    }

    // 2nd constructor
    public Rectangle(int width, int height) 
    {
        this(0, 0, width, height); // calls 3rd constructor
    }

    // 3rd constructor
    public Rectangle(int x, int y, int width, int height) 
    {
        // initialize variables
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
        this.width = width;
        this.height = height;
    }
}
```
- It shows an example of effective constructor chaining using ```this()```.
- The code is highlighted as "GOOD" because the constructors use constructor chaining with ```this()``` to reuse the initialization logic of the most comprehensive constructor (the 3rd one), which significantly reduces duplicated code.

## ✅ **This vs Super**
```java
class Shape 
{
    private int x;
    private int y;

    public Shape(int x, int y) 
    {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }
}

class Rectangle extends Shape 
{
    private int width;
    private int height;

    // 1st constructor
    public Rectangle(int x, int y) 
    {
        this(x, y, 0, 0); // calls 2nd constructor
    }

    // 2nd constructor
    public Rectangle(int x, int y, int width, int height) 
    {
        super(x, y); // calls constructor from parent (Shape)
        this.width = width;
        this.height = height;
    }
}
```
- In this example, we have a class Shape, with x and y instance variables, and class Rectangle that extends Shape with variables width and height.
- In the Rectangle class, the 1st constructor is calling the 2nd constructor using this().
- The 2nd constructor calls the parent constructor with parameters x and y using super(x, y).
- The parent constructor will initialize the x and y variables, while the 2nd Rectangle constructor will initialize the width and height variables.
- Here, we have both the super() and this() calls.
